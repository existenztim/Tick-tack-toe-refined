# Vue Tick Tack Toe

## [Live demo](https://deluxe-pothos-c81544.netlify.app)
This is a simple Vue based tick tack toe game I created with Vue.js and Composition API for a modern Vue experience. All of the data is stored locally within localStorage so it is persistent and data is saved between page refreshes. The game board is a 3x3 grid with freely clickable squares and full rules of the game are implemented so it is perfect for any level of player (new or experienced).
